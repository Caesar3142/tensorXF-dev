TensorCFD is a project developed by pttensor.com to help accelerate the deployment of OpenFOAM technology in real-world industrial applications. It consists of a collection of templates for specific applications. You simply copy and paste the template, then replace it with your own geometry or boundary conditions!
TensorXF is a part of Tensor CFD project, designed for external flow aerodynamics, incompressible, steady, isothermal, with RAS turbulent model to simulate aircraft, UAV, road vehicles, buildings, sporting goods, and any other external flow cases.
Please include credit to "tensorXF" in your work as acknowledgment if you use this template folder.
